; Orx settings template / UTF-8 unicode support

; Sections are defined using [ ]
; Example:
; [My section]

; Everything after a ';' is considered as comment

; Key/value pairs are written like this:
; MyKey = MyValue
; Warning! If you want to add comments, use the ';' separator
; Example:
; MyKey = MyValue; Everything I wrote now is part of comments and not of the value

; If you want to use a ';' in a non-numerical value, use a block assignation delimited with '"'
; Example:
; MyKey = "MyValuePart1 ; MyValuePart2"
; Blocks are also useful for assigning multi-line values
; Example:
; MyKey = "This value
; spans
; on multiple lines"

; If you double the first '"', the value won't be considered as a block but as a regular one. It'll still contain a '"' at the start of the string value;
;Example:
; MyKey = ""MyQuotedValue"
; The string <"MyQuotedValue">, including the quotes, will be stored as a value

; All sections can inherit from any other one using the inheritance marker '@'
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey1 = MyValue1;
; MyKey2 = MyValue2;
; [Object@Template] <= This section will contains all values defined in the section 'Template';

; A parent can be removed when overriding a section and using no name after '@'.
; The implicit default parent section can be forcely ignored using the specific '@@' syntax
; Example:
; [Object] <= This section doesn't use any explicit parent but will use the implicit default parent if defined (see SettingsTemplate.ini, section [Config])
; [Object@Template] <= This section now uses 'Template' as an explicit parent section;
; [Object@] <= This section now has removed any explicit parent but is still using the implicit default parent if defined (see SettingsTemplate.ini, section [Config]))
; [Object@@] <= This section now has removed any parent and will not use the implicit default parent section either

; All values can be locally inherited from another section using the inheritance marker '@', with the optional use of '.' if we want to specify another key
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey = MyValue;
; MyOtherKey = MyOtherValue;
; [Object]
; MyKey = @Template; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be inherited from the one in the section 'Template', with the same key. This inheritance can be chained;
; MyLastKey = @Template.MyKey; <= The value for 'MyLastKey' will be inherited from the section 'Template' using the key 'MyKey'. This inheritance can also be chained;
; NB: MyOtherKey isn't inherited in this case.

; All values can implicitely refer to their own section using the inheritance marker '@' by itself. Its value will be dynamic and carry and inheritance to always result the name of the child section;
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey = @; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be 'Template', the name of this section
; MyOtherKey = @; <= Same here, the value for 'MyOtherKey' will also be the name of this section: 'Template'
; [Object@Template]
; MyNewKey = @; <= The value for 'MyNewKey' will be 'Object'
; MyKey = @Template; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be inherited from the section 'Template' using the same key and its value will be 'Object', ie. this section, not the parent one, 'Template'
; NB: MyOtherKey will use the section inheritance and its value will be 'Object', ie. this section, not the parent one, 'Template'

; If you want to load another file, you need to write this on an empty line:
; @path/to/MyOtherFile@
; Loading will happen instantly in the parsing, which can override previously defined values
; Also, values defined in the "included" file can be overridden afterward
; Lastly, after loading an "included" file, parsing will continue in the same section as before
; Example:
; [MySection]
; Key1 = Var1;
; @IncludeFile@
; Key2 = Var2; <= this will be added to the 'MySection' section

; FLOAT values are expressed with a '.' as decimal separator.
; INT values can be expressed using different prefixes (not case sensitive):
; - decimal without any prefix: 16
; - hexadecimal with prefix '0x': 0x10
; - octal with prefix '0': 020
; - binary with prefix '0b': 0b10000
; VECTOR values are expressed this way:
; MyVector = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0); NB: { } can be used in place of ( ). Components can be (x, y, z) most of the time, or (r, g, b) for color

; Wherever numerical values are used (Ints, Floats and Vectors), a random generated value can be obtained using the separator ~.
; Example:
; Value1 = 0.5 ~ 1.0;
; Value2 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ~ (1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

; You can also specify lists of values using the separator #.
; The default behavior will be to select randomly a value from a list *EXCEPT* if a list item index is provided in the code.
; For all properties defined in this template, values will be taken randomly if a list is provided for any field that doesn't explicitely accept one.
; Lists can contain random values.
; Example:
; Key1 = Var1 # Var2 # RandVar3 ~ RandVar4 # Var5;
; Lists can span multiple lines when using # at the end of the line (line ending comments are allowed).
; If you want to define an empty element at the end of a list, use ##
; Example:
; Key2 = Var1 # Var2 #
;        Var3 #; This list still continues on next line and this comment is valid.
;        Var4  ; This list is now complete and contains 4 elements.
; Key3 = Var1 # Var2 ##; This list will not span on the next line but will contain a 3rd (and last) empty element.
