/* This is a basic C tutorial showing how to do a parallax scrolling.
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - F12 to capture a screenshot
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation, clock, animation, viewport, sound, FX and physics/collision handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows how to display a parallax scrolling.
 *
 * As you can see, there's no special code for the parallax scrolling. Actually,
 * orx's default 2D render plugin will take care of this for you, depending on how you
 * set the objects' properties in the config file. By default, AutoScroll is set to 'both'.
 *
 * This means a parallax scrolling will happen on both X and Y axis when the camera moves.
 * You can try to set this value to x, y or even remove it.
 *
 * Along the AutoScroll property, you can find the DepthScale one. This one is used to automatically
 * adjust objects' scale depending on how far they are from the camera.
 * The smaller the camera frustum is, the faster this autoscale will apply. You can try to play with
 * object positionning and camera near & far planes to achieve the desired scrolling and depth scale you want.
 *
 * You can change the scrolling speed (ie. the camera move speed) in the config file. As usual, you can
 * modify its value in real time and ask for a config history reload.
 *
 * As you can see, our update code simply moves the camera in the 3D space.
 * Pressing arrows will move it along X and Y axis, and pressing control & alt keys will move it along the Z one.
 * As told before, all the parallax scrolling will happen because objects have been flagged appropriately.
 * Your code merely needs to move your camera in your scenery, without having to bother about any scrolling effect.
 * This gives you a full control about how many scrolling planes you want, and which objects should be affected by it.
 *
 * The last point concerns the sky. As seen in the tutorial 03_Frame, we set the sky object's frame as a child
 * of the camera one. This means the position set for the sky object in the config file will always be
 * relative to the camera one.
 * In other words, the sky will always follow the camera, and as we put it, by default, at a depth of 1000 (ie. the
 * same value as the camera far frustum plane), it'll stay in the background.
