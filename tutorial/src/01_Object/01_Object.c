/* This is a basic C tutorial creating a viewport and an object.
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * As orx is data driven, here we just write 2 lines of code to create a viewport
 * and an object, but all their properties can be defined in the config file (01_Object.ini).
 * As a matter of fact, the viewport is associated with a camera implicitly created from the
 * info given in the config file. You can also set their sizes, positions, the object colors,
 * scales, rotations, animations, physical properties, and so on. You can even request
 * random values for these without having to add a single line of code.
 * In a later tutorial we'll see how to generate your whole scene (all background
 * and landscape objects for example) with a simple for loop written in 3 lines of code.
 *
 * For now, you can try to uncomment some of the lines of 01_Object.ini, play with them,
 * then relaunch this tutorial. For an exhaustive list of options, please look at CreationTemplate.ini.
