/* This is a basic C tutorial creating objects with animations.
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation and clock handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows how to handle animation graphs.
 *
 * As graph could quickly become very complex, here we only have 4 animations here: IdleRight, IdleLeft, WalkRight and WalkLeft.
 *
 * All the possible transitions are defined in the config file. When you request an animation
 * as target, the engine will figure out how to chain the animations to arrive at the requested one.
 * In the same way, if no animation are requested, it'll follow the links according to their priorities.
 *
 * There's also loop and random control as WIP, so they won't be described in this tutorial.
 *
 * As for an example, if the soldier was in WalkRight and you stop pressing keys, it'll know
 * he has to go immediately to IdleRight, without having code to give this order.
 *
 * We also show how to subscribe to the animation events so as to know when animations are started, stopped or cut.
