/* This is a basic C tutorial creating objects with linked (hierarchy) frames.
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation and clock handling.
 * All positions/scales/rotations are stored in orxFRAME for orx objects.
 * These frame are assembled in a hierarchy graph, meaning that changing a parent frame
 * properties will affect all its children.
 * Here we have four objects that we link to a common parent (an empty object) and a fifth one which has no parent.
 * You can use arrow keys to move the parent object, '+' & '-' to scale it, left & right mouse button to rotate it.
 * All these transformation will affect its children.
 * This provides us with an easy way to create grouped object or complex object assembly and transform them
 * (position, scale, rotation, speed, ...) very easily.
 *
 * NB: If you change the viewport size and position, the function orxRender_GetWorldPosition() will still
 * return a valid information. You can test it by changing the viewport properties in the config file.
