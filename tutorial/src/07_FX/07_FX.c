/* This is a basic C tutorial creating visual FXs.
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation, clock, animation, viewport and sound handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows what FXs are and how to create them.
 *
 * FXs are based on a combination of curves based on sine, saw or linear shape, applied on different parameters
 * suchs as scale, rotation, alpha, color and position.
 *
 * FXs are set through config file requiring only one line of code to apply them on an object.
 * There can be up to 5 curves of any type combined to form an FX. Up to 4 FXs can be applied
 * on the same object at a given time.
 *
 * FX can set absolute or relative values, depending on the attribute Absolute in its config.
 * Control over curve period, phasis, pow, amplification over time is also granted.
 * For rotation FXs, value can use object's orientation and/or scale on demand.
 * This allows the creation of pretty elaborated and great looking visual FXs.
 *
 * FX parameters can be tweaked in the config file and reloaded on-the-fly using backspace,
 * unless the FX was specified to be kept in cache memory (with the attribute KeepInCache).
 *
 * For example you won't be able to tweak on the fly the circle FX as it's defined
 * with this attribute in the default config file. All the other FXs can be updated while
 * the tutorial run, at their next application.
 *
 * As always, random parameters can be used from config allowing some variety for a single FX.
 * For example, the wobble scale, the flash color and the "attack" of the move FX are using limited random values.
 *
 * We also register to the FX events to display when FXs are played and stopped.
 * As the FX played on the box object is tagget as looping, it'll never stop and thus
 * the corresponding event (FX_STOP) won't ever be sent.
 *
 * We also show briefly how to add some personal user data to an orxOBJECT (here a structure containing a single boolean).
 * We retrieve it in the event callback to lock the object when an FX starts and unlock it when it stops.
 * We use this lock to allow only one FX at a time on the soldier. It's only written here as a didactic purpose.
