/* This is a basic C++ tutorial showing how to write a stand alone executable using orx.
 * As we are *NOT* using the default executable anymore for this tutorial, the tutorial
 * code will be directly in the executable and not in an external library.
 *
 * We thus are able to specify what we need (physics or not, display or not, etc...).
 * However we will *NOT* have the default hardcoded behavior:
 * - F11 will not affect vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape won't exit
 * - Backspace won't reload configuration files
 * - the [Main] section in the config file won't be used to load a plugin ("GameFile" key)
 *
 * Our program, by default, will also *NOT* exit if it receives the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE event.
 * To do so, we will either have to use the helper orx_Execute() function (see below)
 * or handle it ourselves.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation, clock, animation,
 * viewport, sound, FX, physics/collision and differentiel scrolling handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows how to create your stand alone game using orx as a library.
 *
 * As we're on our own here, we need to write the main function and initialize orx manually.
 * The good thing is that we can then specify which modules we want to use, and deactivates display
 * or any other module at will, if needed.
 *
 * If we still want a semi-automated initialization of orx, we can use the orx_Execute() function.
 * This tutorial will cover the use of orx with this helper function, but you can decide not to use
 * it if its behavior doesn't suit your needs.
 *
 * This helper function will take care of initializing everything correctly and exiting properly.
 * It will also make sure the clock module is constantly ticked (as it's orx's core) and that
 * we exit if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE event is sent.
 * This event is sent when closing the windows, for example, but it can also be sent under
 * your own criteria (escape key pressed, for example).
 * We'll see that even if this event is handled by default, we can still override it.
 * To give an example, this tutorial won't close using the default scheme as you will see in its code.
 *
 * This code is a basic C++ example to show how to use orx without having to write C code.
 *
 * This tutorial could have been architectured in a better way (cutting it into pieces with headers files, for example)
 * but we wanted to keep a single file per *basic* tutorial.
 *
 * This stand alone executable also creates a console (as does the default orx executable),
 * but you can have you own console-less program if you wish. You only need to provide an arc/argv style
 * parameter list that contains the executable name, otherwise the default config file will be
 * orx.ini instead of 10_StandAlone.ini here.
 *
 * For windows visual studio users, it can easily be achieved by writing a WinMain() function instead of main(),
 * and by getting the executable name (or hardcoding it).
 *
 * This tutorial simply display an orx logo, and will only exit if backspace is pressed. If you try to exit using
 * the windows 'X' button or by pressing alt-F4, a message will be displayed and the logo color will change.
 *
 * Some explanations about core elements you can find in this tutorial:
 *
 * - Setup function: usually used to define module dependencies.
 *   Here we add dependencies for the main module (our code).
 *   This specifies a hierarchical tree used for modules init, exit and pause.
 *   For our program to run, we require the param, clock, config, event and plugin modules
 *   to be loaded before us.
 *   They all have their internal dependencies that must be satisfied before they can be initialized.
 *   If a dependency can't be satisfied initialization will stop.
 *   For example, if the clock module can't initialize properly, as we depend on it,
 *   our Init() function will never be called.
 *   We can specify optional dependencies using the orxModule_AddOptionalDependency()
 *   This way, orx will try to init the concerned module but won't stop initialization if
 *   it fails.
 *
 * - Run function: Don't put *ANY* logic code here, it's only a backbone where you can handle default
 *   core behaviors (tracking exit, for example) or profile some stuff.
 *   As it's directly called from the main loop and not part of the clock system, time consistency can't be achieved.
 *   For all your main game execution, please create (or use an existing) clock and register your callback to it.
 *
 * - Event handlers:
 *   When an event handler returns orxSTATUS_SUCCESS, no other handler will be called after it
 *   for the same event.
 *   For example, that's how we inhibit the default exit behavior for orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE event.
 *   On the other hand, if orxSTATUS_FAILURE is returned, event processing will continue for this one
 *   if other handlers are listening this event type.
 *
 * - orx_Execute():
 *   Inits and executes orx using our self-defined functions (Setup, Init, Run and Exit).
 *   We can of course not use this helper and handles everything manually if its
 *   behavior doesn't suit our needs.
 *   You can have a look at the content of orx_Execute() (which is implemented in orx.h) to have
 *   a better idea on how to do this.
