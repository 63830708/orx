/* This is a basic C tutorial creating viewports and cameras.
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation, clock and animation handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows how to use multiple viewports with multiple cameras.
 * By default, it'll create 4 viewports.
 *
 * The top left corner one (1) and the bottom right corner one (4)
 * shares the same camera (1). To achieve this, we just need to use the same name in the config file.
 * Furthermore, when manipulating this camera using left & right mouse buttons to rotate it,
 * arrow keys to move it and '+' & '-' to zoom it, these two viewports will be affected.
 *
 * The top right viewport (2) is based on another camera (2) which frustum is narrower than the first one,
 * resulting in a display twice as big. You can't affect this viewport through keys for this tutorial.
 * 
 * The last viewport (3) is based on another camera (3) which has the exact same settings than the first one.
 * This viewport will display what you originally had in the viewport 1 & 4.
 * You can also interact directly with the first viewport properties, using WASD to move it and 'Q' & 'E' to resize it.
 * 
 * When two viewports overlap, the oldest one (ie. the one created before the other) will be displayed on top.
 *
 * Lastly, we have a box that doesn't move at all, and a little soldier whose world position will be determined
 * by the current mouse on-screen position.
 * In other words, no matter which viewport your mouse is on, and no matter how is set the camera for this viewport
 * the soldier will always have his feet at the same position than your mouse on screen (provided it's in a viewport).
 *
 * Viewports and objects are created with random colors and sizes using the character '~' in config file.
 *
 * NB: Cameras store their position/zoom/rotation in an orxFRAME structure, thus allowing them to be part of the orxFRAME
 * hierarchy. (cf. tutorial 03_Frame)
 * For example, object auto-following can be achieved by setting object's frame as camera's frame parent.
