/* This is a basic C tutorial creating sounds effects and musics (streams).
 * As we are using the default executable for this tutorial, this code
 * will be loaded and executed as a runtime plugin.
 *
 * In addition, some basics are handled for us by the main executable.
 * First of all, it will load all available plugins and modules. If you
 * require only some of those, then it's better to write your own executable
 * instead of a plugin. This will be covered in a later tutorial.
 *
 * The main executable also handles some keys:
 * - F11 as vertical sync toggler
 * - Escape as exit key
 * - F12 to capture a screenshot
 * - Backspace to reload all configuration files (provided that config history is turned on)
 * It also exits if the orxSYSTEM_EVENT_CLOSE signal is sent.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation, clock, animation and viewport handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows how to play sounds (samples) and musics (streams).
 * As with other features from previous behavior, it only requires, most of the time,
 * a single line of code, everything being data driven.
 *
 * It also demonstrates how to alter their settings in real time, using the soldier as a visual feedback.
 *
 * If you press up & down arrows, the music volume will change accordingly. The soldier will be scale in consequence.
 * By pressing left & right arrows, the music pitch (frequency) will change. The soldier will rotate like a knob.
 *
 * Left control key will play the music (and activate the soldier) if the music was paused,
 * otherwise it'll pause the music (and deactivate the soldier).
 *
 * Lastly, enter and space will play a sound effect on the soldier. Space triggered sound effect
 * is the same as enter except that its volume and pitch are randomly defined in the default config file.
 *
 * This allows to easily generate step or hit sounds with variety with no extra line of code.
 * We randomly change the soldier's color to illustrate this.
 * NB: The sound effect will only be added and played on an active soldier.
 * If you want to play a sound effect with no object as support,
 * you can do it the same way we create the music in this tutorial.
 * However, playing a sound on an object will allow spatial sound positioning (not covered by this tutorial).
 *
 * Many sound effects can be played at the same time on a single object.
 *
 * The sound config attribute KeepDataInCache allows to keep the sound sample
 * in memory instead of rereading it from file every time.
 * This only works for non-streamed data (ie. not for musics).
 * If it's set to false, the sample will be reloaded from file, unless there's currently
 * another sound effect of the same type being played.
 *
 * We also register to the sound events to display when sound effects are played and stopped.
 * These events are only sent for sound effects played on objects.
