Orx - Portable Game Engine  (Version 1.3)

=============================================================================

orx 1.3
---
* *** Added new platform with full support (better sound support in the next version): android. ***
* IMPORTANT: Added OpenGL ES 2.0 support for iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad + full shader pipeline (including custom shader support)
* IMPORTANT: Mingw dev package has binaries built with gcc 4.5.0 which are *NOT* compatible with older versions of gcc. Please upgrade or recompile orx and dependencies.
* IMPORTANT: Added physics joints support and updated to Box2D 2.1.3 (svn v140, pre-release) which impacts on some physics settings (no more world boundaries, etc...)
* IMPORTANT: a ChildJointList can be specified in config for building complex objects with joints, along the ChildList config property
* IMPORTANT: iPhone touch, motion and accelerometer events have now been merged with android ones in orxSYSTEM_EVENT_*
* IMPORTANT: Added sound recording (to memory and/or disk with various file format support, with possibility of analyzing/pre-processing the samples through events)
* IMPORTANT: When playing a sound stream, the packets can be analized/altered on the fly (for realtime effects, for example)
* IMPORTANT: Rendering to texture support is back with GLFW & iPhone plugins
* IMPORTANT: orxSYSTEM_EVENT_BACKGROUND & orxSYSTEM_EVENT_FOREGROUND have been added to handle new iOS 4 "backgrounding" for application and will deactivate any rendering made by orx by defaault
* IMPORTANT: Scale for objects with a ParentCamera is now expressed in camera space, by default.
* IMPORTANT: Custom event config syntax has changed (please check CreationTemplate.ini): they are now bound to keys and don't require a timestamp
* IMPORTANT: If a shader parameter is defined as an explicit list, an array will be created instead of a single variable
* IMPORTANT: UseParentSpace config property for objects with a ParentCamera now take additional values: both, non, positiona and scale
* IMPORTANT: UseRotation/UseScale in spawner config changed: when set to false, no rotation/scale will be applied to the created object by the spawner and UseRelativeSpeed will always use spawner's parent orientation/scale
* IMPORTANT: Added Tutorial #12, Shader and Lighting
* IMPORTANT: Added Smooth(step) curve for orxFXs
* Optimized home render plugin to batch objects by texture (5-15% FPS boost, depending on scenes)
* Optimized frame update for orphan objects (6-8% FPS boost)
* Optimized GLFW and iPhone rendering: batching + indexing + interlacing -> 10 - 100% FPS boost
* Orx will now use the current desktop resolution if none if provided
* Orx has perfect synchronization between sound playing and sound recording to allow on the fly analysis/modication of sound packets
* When selecting a new input set, the inputs status will be updated immediately to make sure holding key/button won't register as a new status
* Better mouse axis handling in the input module: when user manually moves the cursor to simulate a capture, this won't affect input's values
* Added JoystickMultiplier to input module: all joystick axis values will be multiplied by this value to allow scaling and a more seamless joystick/mouse input integration
* Anims can now contain 65535 keys and 65535 events
* Added orxDisplay_GetBitmapData()
* Added optional depth buffer creation + better user-defined external rendering support (such as custom 3D rendering)
* Added CleanOnDelete in spawner config to delete all alive spawned objects when their spawner is deleted
* Minor internal pipeline/vertex shader optimization
* Added dlmalloc as internal default memory allocator
* Clock DT and orxSystemGetTime() are now using double precision and can support much much longer uptimes

* Fixed full executable path handling on init
* Misc optimizations & fixes

orx 1.2
-----
* *** Added new platform with full support: iPhone (iPod Touch/iPad). ***
* *** Orx is now published under the zlib license, please see the LICENSE file. ***
* IMPORTANT: Added Unicode support with UTF-8. Config files now should be encoded with either plain ANSI or UTF-8: extended ASCII characters (ISO-Latin-1) won't be recognized any longer.
* IMPORTANT: Added custom bitmap font support in orx with Jørgen 'Jibs' Ibsen's Dina font as default.
* IMPORTANT: Added the orxFontGen tool to create orx-compatible bitmap fonts (.tga/.ini) from TrueType (.ttf) font files, using reference texts to define the list of characters to export.
* IMPORTANT: Joystick buttons/axes are now suffixed with the corresponding joystick's ID (JOY_X_1, JOY_1_2, ...).
* IMPORTANT: Added new plugins for embedded versions: SDL plugins for win/linux (35-40% than the SFML ones) and GLFW plugins for win/linux/osx (~2% faster than SDL ones).
* IMPORTANT: Added an OpenAL/libsndfile/stb_vorbis audio plugin as SFML audio plugin counterpart.
* IMPORTANT: SDL & GLFW now handle per-object shaders in a correct manner: shader is only applied when the object is rendered and only on it. This behavior can't be obtained with SFML plugins.
* IMPORTANT: Added an internal texture called "pixel" that holds a white pixel with full opacity. This can be used for all fade in/out effects and more.
* Added automatically generated coordinates for shader textures: Texture MyTex -> MyTex_Top, MyTex_Left, MyTex_Right & MyTex_Bottom are generated by orx in a consistant way across all platforms/plugins.
* GLFW plugins are now the default plugins for embedded mode. SFML plugins are still the only existing plugins for non-embedded mode.
* GLFW and SDL plugins also use SOIL library for handling graphic files I/O
* Fixed incorrectly names joystick axes
* Texts can use localized fonts using the locale module in the same way as string content
* Added orxBank_GetIndex() & orxBank_GetAtIndex() for array-like manipulations
* Heavy optims in the orxBANK module when allocating cells and clearing banks

* Added orxMOUSE_X and orxMOUSE_Y as valid inputs for the generic input system
* Added HSL/HSV color space support with HSL<->RGB & HSV<->RGB conversion functions
* Added ParentCamera property for cameras (useful for cascading cameras or Fixed/UI camera trick for portrait<->landscape adaptation)
* When selecting a new locale language at runtime, graphics containing localized text will now resize accordingly to the text's new size
* Added __orxFREEBASIC__ define for free basic friendly build of orx
* orxClock_RemoveTimer() can now filter using the registered context
* Added events orxCONFIG_EVENT_RELOAD_START, orxCONFIG_EVENT_RELOAD_END & orxCONFIG_EVENT_INVALID_TYPE_ACCESS

* Fixed FPS display position when aspect ratio is not 1:1
* Removed a couple of warnings from external library Box2D
* Fixed some minor issues in SFML-based sound plugin
* Config raw sections/values can now be accessed at runtime (used in EyeCreate's orx config editor Pey)
* Fixed sound attenuation ratio in SFML plugin
* Added Config::IgnorePath parameter to ignore all paths when loading resources (useful for iPhone bundles were all files easily end up in the root folder)
* Modules' Init & Exit functions are now optional (ie. stand alone application don't have to define them if not needed).
* Default minimal frequency for the home made renderer plugin is now 10Hz (was 60Hz).
* Fixed orxLOCALE_EVENT_SET_STRING not sent
* Some optims / fixes / cleaning
